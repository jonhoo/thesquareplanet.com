		Hi there! I'm a Principal Engineer at
		<a href="https://helsing.ai/">Helsing</a>,
		author of
		<a href="https://rust-for-rustaceans.com/">Rust for Rustaceans</a>,
		an avid
		<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/JonGjengset">Rust educator</a>,
		and a general <a href="https://github.com/jonhoo">open-source enthusiast</a>.
		I have a PhD from the
		<a href="https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/">Parallel and Distributed Operating Systems group</a>
		at MIT, where I was supervised by
		<a href="http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/rtm/">Robert Morris</a>
		in my work on
		<a href="https://jon.thesquareplanet.com/papers/phd-thesis.pdf">Noria</a>,
		which today continues in the form of a start-up I co-founded called
		<a href="https://readyset.io/">ReadySet</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Before Helsing, I maintained the Rust build infrastructure at
		AWS. And before MIT, I received an MSc in Networked Computer
		Systems from <a href="https://ucl.ac.uk">UCL</a> in the UK, and
		a BSc in Information Technology from
		<a href="http://bond.edu.au">Bond University</a> in Australia.
		My various research projects, you can find on the
		<a href="research/">research page</a>.

		I occasionally <a href="blog/">write at length</a> about things
		I find interesting. You can follow me on various platforms
		using the links at the top, or
